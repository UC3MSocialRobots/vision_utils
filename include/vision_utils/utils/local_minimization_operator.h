/*! Given a vector q with n elements,
a bounded minimization operator can be applied,
that sets each element equal
to the minimum of all elements in a vicinity bounded by delta.
The only reason for the different ranges in k is that
the minimization cannot be done outside the defined
range of qi.

 \param q
 \param q_out
    Must be of size q_size, otherwise will generate segfaults!
 \param q_size
 \param window_size
